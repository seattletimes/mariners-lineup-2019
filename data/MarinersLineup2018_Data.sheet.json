    "best": "A season like the one he had last year with the Marlins when he hit .308 and stole 60 bases. He isn't going to walk often, so he needs to hit about .300 to have an on-base percentage approaching .350. Perhaps just as important as his offense will be how he adapts to playing at his new position in center field. He has the speed and the arm to do it, and he has performed well in center in spring training. Still, there will likely be some growing pains. They just can't be too severe.",
    "worst": "In 2015 with Miami, he led the National League in batting average (.333), hits (205) and stolen bases (58). Was the first player to lead the NL in batting average and stolen bases since Jackie Robinson in 1949. ... His father, Tom, won 138 games during a 21-year career in the major leagues.",

His home runs dropped from 20 to 11 and his batting average fell 19 points. That said, he did have another very good offensive year and there is no reason he can't deliver again this year. Any improvement would cement him as as on the AL's best shortstops.",

At age 35, it's not reasonable to expect a return to the 2016 production when he had a career-high 39 home runs, and 103 runs batted in,  his most in four seasons with the Mariners. But Seattle needs a season at least similar to last year.",

    "best": "It might be getting greedy, but it would sure help if he could somehow avoid what has become an annual slow start to the season. If he could also avoid prolonged slumps, it would help him bounce back from a season when he hit a career-low .249. Power numbers similar to last year would be just fine, and the Mariners need him to remain durable (at least 154 games in six straight seasons) and to continue being a leader in the clubhouse.",

Younger brother Justin was drafted by the Mariners in the 12th round in 2013 and is now out of pro baseball.

Healy, acquired in a trade from Oakland over the offseason, hit 25 homers and batted .271 for the A's last season. Even just a bit of improvement in his third season in the big leagues would make him a big upgrade over what the Mariners have been getting at that position. The Mariners will also need him to stay healthy after missing most of spring training because of hand surgery.",

He was perhaps the Mariners' best hitter early in the season, and although he tailed off later in the season after getting hurt, he still put up nice offensive numbers in his rookie season. The Mariners have had other players in recent years regress in their second season, and the team needs him to be at least as productive as he was in 2017.",
